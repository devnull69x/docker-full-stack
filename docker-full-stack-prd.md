# Docker Full Stack Infrastructure PRD

## Overview

A comprehensive infrastructure stack using Docker containers for:

- Secure container orchestration
- Monitoring and logging
- DNS and reverse proxy services
- Authentication and security services

## Core Features

### Container Management

- Portainer for container management
- Docker garbage collection
- Log rotation for containers

### Networking

- Traefik reverse proxy with:
  - Automatic SSL via Let's Encrypt
  - Middleware chains for security
  - Rate limiting
- PowerDNS for internal DNS

### Security

- CrowdSec for intrusion prevention
- Authelia for authentication
- Container security hardening via:
  - User namespace remapping
  - AppArmor profiles
  - Seccomp policies

### Monitoring

- Grafana dashboards
- Prometheus metrics collection
- Log aggregation

## Technical Architecture

### System Components

- Docker containers for all services
- Ansible for configuration management
- GlusterFS for persistent storage

### Data Models

- YAML-based configuration for all services
- JSON templates for security policies

### Infrastructure Requirements

- Linux hosts with Docker installed
- Minimum 4GB RAM per node
- SSD storage recommended

## Development Roadmap

### Phase 1: Core Infrastructure

- Container management (Portainer)
- Reverse proxy setup (Traefik)
- Basic monitoring

### Phase 2: Security Layer

- Authentication (Authelia)
- Intrusion prevention (CrowdSec)
- Container hardening

### Phase 3: Advanced Features

- DNS service (PowerDNS)
- Distributed storage (GlusterFS)
- Advanced monitoring

## Logical Dependency Chain

1. Core container management must be first
2. Networking and reverse proxy next
3. Security features can be added incrementally
4. Monitoring should be implemented early

## Risks and Mitigations

### Technical Challenges

- Container networking complexity
- Mitigation: Start with simple bridge networks

### Resource Constraints

- Memory requirements for multiple containers
- Mitigation: Optimize container resource limits

## Appendix

### Compliance Standards

- CIS Docker Benchmark
- NIST 800-53 controls
- DISA STIG requirements
