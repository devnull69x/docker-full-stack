# Overview  
The Docker Full Stack project is a comprehensive infrastructure-as-code solution for deploying and managing containerized applications. It solves the problem of complex container orchestration by providing pre-configured, production-ready Docker stacks with security, monitoring, and high availability built in. The target users are DevOps engineers and infrastructure teams who need to quickly deploy secure container environments.

# Core Features  
- **Multi-Stack Management**: Predefined stacks for different use cases (monitoring, databases, etc.)
  - Why important: Saves configuration time and ensures best practices
  - How it works: YAML files define each stack with optimal settings

- **Security Hardening**: Built-in security configurations for Docker and containers
  - Why important: Reduces attack surface and meets compliance requirements
  - How it works: Ansible playbooks apply CIS benchmarks and other security standards

- **Monitoring Stack**: Integrated monitoring with Prometheus, Grafana, and alerting
  - Why important: Provides visibility into container performance and health
  - How it works: Preconfigured dashboards and metrics collection

# User Experience  
- **Primary Persona**: DevOps Engineer
  - Needs to quickly deploy production-ready container infrastructure
  - Requires security compliance out of the box
  - Values automation and reproducibility

- **Key User Flows**:
  1. Stack deployment via compose files
  2. Security hardening via Ansible
  3. Monitoring setup and configuration

- **UI/UX Considerations**:
  - CLI-first experience with clear documentation
  - Portainer for visual management
  - Grafana for monitoring visualization

# Technical Architecture  
- **System Components**:
  - Docker Engine with Swarm mode
  - Traefik reverse proxy
  - Portainer management UI
  - Monitoring stack (Prometheus, Grafana, Alertmanager)

- **Data Models**:
  - Container configuration stored in YAML
  - Ansible variables for environment-specific settings

- **APIs and Integrations**:
  - Docker API for container management
  - Prometheus API for metrics collection
  - Traefik API for dynamic configuration

- **Infrastructure Requirements**:
  - Linux hosts with Docker installed
  - Minimum 4GB RAM per node
  - Network connectivity between nodes

# Development Roadmap  
**MVP Phase**:
- Core Docker stack deployment
- Basic security hardening
- Essential monitoring

**Phase 2**:
- Advanced security configurations
- High availability setup
- Backup and recovery

**Phase 3**:
- Multi-cloud deployment support
- Automated compliance reporting
- Self-healing capabilities

# Logical Dependency Chain
1. Foundation: Docker and basic networking
2. Core Services: Reverse proxy and management UI
3. Security: Hardening playbooks and configurations
4. Monitoring: Metrics collection and visualization
5. Advanced: HA, backup, cross-cloud support

# Risks and Mitigations  
- **Technical Challenges**:
  - Complex networking requirements
  - Mitigation: Predefined network configurations

- **MVP Scope**:
  - Defining minimal viable feature set
  - Mitigation: Focus on core container management first

- **Resource Constraints**:
  - Limited testing environments
  - Mitigation: Use CI/CD for automated testing

# Appendix  
- **Research Findings**:
  - CIS Docker Benchmark v1.4.0
  - NIST SP 800-190 container security guidelines

- **Technical Specifications**:
  - Docker 20.10+
  - Ansible 2.10+
  - Traefik 2.6+
