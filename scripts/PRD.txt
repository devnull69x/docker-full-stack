# Overview  
Docker Full Stack is an infrastructure management platform that provides a complete container orchestration solution with security, monitoring, and automation capabilities. It solves the problem of complex container infrastructure management by providing:

- Centralized container management via Portainer
- Reverse proxy and load balancing via Traefik
- Monitoring via Grafana and Prometheus
- Security hardening via Ansible playbooks
- Automated deployment and configuration

The target users are DevOps engineers and infrastructure teams who need a production-ready container platform with security best practices built-in.

# Core Features  

1. **Container Management**
   - Portainer CE for GUI container management
   - Docker Swarm support for orchestration
   - Automated container garbage collection
   - Why: Provides visibility and control over container infrastructure

2. **Reverse Proxy & Routing**
   - Traefik with Let's Encrypt integration
   - Dynamic configuration for services
   - Middleware for security headers and rate limiting
   - Why: Essential for exposing services securely

3. **Monitoring Stack**
   - Grafana dashboards
   - Prometheus metrics collection
   - Log aggregation
   - Why: Critical for observability and troubleshooting

4. **Security Hardening**
   - CIS Docker Benchmark compliance
   - Automated security remediation via Ansible
   - CrowdSec for intrusion prevention
   - Why: Meets compliance requirements and reduces attack surface

5. **Automation**
   - Ansible playbooks for provisioning
   - Infrastructure as Code approach
   - Automated certificate management
   - Why: Enables reproducible deployments

# User Experience  

**Primary Personas:**
1. DevOps Engineer - Needs to deploy and manage containers
2. Security Engineer - Needs to ensure compliance
3. Developer - Needs to deploy applications

**Key User Flows:**
1. Initial cluster deployment
2. Service onboarding
3. Security compliance verification
4. Monitoring and alerting setup

**UI/UX Considerations:**
- Portainer interface should be accessible but secure
- Grafana dashboards should be intuitive
- CLI tools should have consistent interfaces

2. Log aggregation
3. Backup/restore capabilities

**Phase 3:**
1. Multi-node cluster support
2. High availability configurations
3. Advanced monitoring and alerting

# Logical Dependency Chain  

1. Foundation:
   - Docker installation and hardening
   - Basic networking
   - Initial Traefik setup

2. Core Services:
   - Portainer
   - Basic monitoring
   - Certificate management

3. Advanced Features:
   - Security scanning
   - Log management
   - HA configurations

# Risks and Mitigations  

**Technical Challenges:**
- Complex networking between containers
  - Mitigation: Use overlay networks and test thoroughly

- Security compliance maintenance
  - Mitigation: Automate checks with Ansible

**Resource Constraints:**
- Limited nodes for testing
  - Mitigation: Use lightweight containers and optimize resource usage

# Appendix  

**Research Findings:**
- CIS Docker Benchmark provides excellent security baseline
- Traefik is more flexible than Nginx for dynamic environments
- Portainer CE meets most management needs without enterprise features

**Technical Specifications:**
- Docker 20.10+
- Ansible 2.10+
- Traefik 2.0+
